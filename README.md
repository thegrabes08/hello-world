# hello-world
First repository to learn how to use Github
I am a self-taught coder working with Codecademy, Code School, Free Code Camp, and Skillcrush. I am currently an Events Manager at a nonprofit but want to learn tech skills in order to change careers. I love the challenge of coding and focuing mostly on front-end development right now, getting the hang of Javascript.
